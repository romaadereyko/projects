Repo with my tryings for multistage deploys of different projects in Docker.
Start docker-compose command with -d parameters in "go" directory and connect to http://IP:80 to see work of simple go application.
Start docker-compose command without any parameters in "java" directory and see "Hello World" application in STDOUT of docker.
